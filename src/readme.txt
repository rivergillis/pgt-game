This game must be run from 'src' folder, such that the 'assets' folder is a subdirectory of the folder in which
the game is run. This is easily accomplished by running the 'build.bash' script, which builds all of
the java files and runs the main() method in Controller.java.

The 'clean.sh' script is used to delete all .class files.
